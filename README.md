### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
DEBUG=True
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

```

### 4.1 Obtaining a Gemini API Key

**Option 1: Get your own Gemini API key**
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) to create your API key
2. Copy your API key to the `constants.py.example` file
3. Rename the file to `constants.py`

**Option 2: Request an API key**
Email bt2639@columbia.edu to request a Gemini API key for this project.

### 5. Database Setup

The project includes a pre-configured SQLite3 database with sample data already loaded. No database migration or setup is required.

If you want to reset the database or start fresh, you can run:

```bash
python manage.py flush  # This will clear all data but keep the structure
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## User Credentials

### Renter Access
- **Username**: `renterMVP`
- **Password**: `rentmatchMVP1`

### Landlord Access

## Core Features

### Property Search

The platform offers advanced property search capabilities:

- **Location-based search**: Find properties in specific neighborhoods or by address keywords
- **Filter by criteria**: Price range, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, amenities
- **Detailed property pages**: View images, features, floor plans, and neighborhood information
- **Save favorites**: Renters can save properties to revisit later

### AI Chatbot Assistant

Our general-purpose AI chatbot helps renters navigate the platform:

- **Natural conversation**: Engage in freeform discussions about rental needs and preferences
- **Property recommendations**: Ask the AI to suggest properties based on your requirements
- **Market information**: Get insights about NYC neighborhoods, rent ranges, and market trends
- **Personalized assistance**: The AI remembers your preferences throughout the conversation
- **Activate**: Access through the chat icon in the navigation bar

#### Chatbot Commands

The chatbot responds to natural language queries such as:
- "Find me a 2-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn under $3000"
- "What's the average rent in Manhattan?"
- "Tell me about the East Village neighborhood"

### Property Applications

The application system streamlines the rental application process:

- **One-click apply**: Renters can apply to properties with a single click
- **Application tracking**: View status of all submitted applications
- **Direct communication**: Message landlords about specific properties
- **Document management**: Upload and share required documentation

### AI Lease Negotiation

The AI-powered lease negotiation system is the core innovative feature:

- **Structured negotiations**: AI facilitates discussions between renters and landlords
- **Legal guidance**: Get information on lease terms, rights, and market standards
- **Term drafting**: AI can help draft clear, equitable lease terms
- **Digital signing**: Finalize leases digitally right in the platform
- **Contextual awareness**: AI tracks the entire conversation history to provide relevant responses

#### How to Use the AI Lease Assistant

1. In a property chat between landlord and renter, type `AI:` followed by your request
2. The AI will only respond when specifically prompted with the `AI:` prefix
3. Example: `AI: Can you help us draft a 12-month lease agreement?`
4. For lease finalization, both parties must type "Yes" followed by their full legal name

## User Flows

### Renter Experience

1. **Sign up/login**: Create an account or log in with test credentials
2. **Complete profile**: Add personal information, income verification, rental history
3. **Search properties**: Use filters or AI chat to find suitable properties
4. **Apply to properties**: Submit applications to properties of interest
5. **Negotiate lease**: Once approved by a landlord, use the AI-assisted negotiation
6. **Sign lease**: Finalize the agreement using the digital signature process

### Landlord Experience

1. **Login**: Use landlord credentials (landlordMVP/landlordMVP)
2. **Review applications**: See all applications submitted by interested renters
3. **Communicate with applicants**: Message renters directly about their applications
4. **Negotiate terms**: Use the AI-assisted platform to finalize lease details
5. **Finalize leases**: Complete the process with digital signatures

## Technical Architecture

RentMatch.AI is built on a modern tech stack:

- **Backend**: Django 5.2 (Python 3.13.3) with Django Channels for WebSockets
- **Database**: SQLite3 (pre-configured with sample data)
- **Real-time communication**: Redis + Django Channels
- **AI integration**: Google Gemini Pro API
- **Frontend**: Django templates with Bootstrap 5 and JavaScript

### Key Components

- **Users app**: Authentication, user profiles, and permissions
- **Negotiation app**: Property listings, applications, and lease negotiation
- **Chatbot app**: General-purpose AI assistance

## API Integrations

- **Google Gemini API**: Powers both the general chatbot and the lease negotiation assistant
- **Property Data API**: Sample property data based on NYC listings

## Admin Commands

### Manage Property Applications

Delete all property applications and messages (useful for testing):

```bash
python manage.py delete_all_applications
```

Use the `--dry-run` flag to preview what would be deleted:

```bash
python manage.py delete_all_applications --dry-run
```

### Load Sample Data

If you've reset the database and need to reload sample data:

```bash
python manage.py load_sample_properties
python manage.py create_test_users
```

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Connection Issues

If you experience connection issues with the chat functionality:

1. Ensure Redis is running
2. Verify Django Channels configuration in `settings.py`
3. Check browser console for WebSocket errors

### AI Assistant Not Responding

1. Verify your Gemini API key is correctly set
2. For negotiation assistant, ensure messages start with `AI:` 
3. Check server logs for any API rate limiting or errors

### Database Reset

If you need to reset the database to its original state:

```bash
# Make a backup of the original db.sqlite3 file first
cp db.sqlite3 db.sqlite3.backup

# Then you can either:
# 1. Restore from the original backup
cp db.sqlite3.backup db.sqlite3

# OR 2. Reset and recreate
python manage.py flush  # Clear all data
python manage.py create_test_users  # Recreate test users
python manage.py load_sample_properties  # Load sample properties
```
